# PulseEffects-Presets
Personally created presets for PulseEffects. Used for a better music output with HyperX Cloud II headset.

Contains my preset file(s) for the rich audio effects library [PulseEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects/)

Preset Details:

1. `HyperX Cloud II` - This preset has been designed to be used with my HyperX Cloud II headset. It enriches the basses without adding the rest of the spectrum, and adds a bit of stereo effect to open up the sound.

## Installation

* Download the `.json` files from the presets you want from this repo.

* Go to your PulseEffects local config directory. If you installed it through Flatpak, you can find it in `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.pulseeffects/config/PulseEffects`, or if you used the PPA for Ubuntu (or the AUR package for Arch) it should be `~/.config/PulseEffects`.

* Copy the previously downloaded presets files to the `output` directory.

* Now you just have to activate the preset in PulseEffects and voil√†.


Enjoy your listening session.
